# Jpeg_carver
A JPEG carver created for CS590k

# How to use

You need to have python 3 and pillow installed. 

You can install pillow via pip using `pip install pillow`

You can run the program with the following syntax `python3 carver.py <image_name>`.

It might generate some junk files but most of the JPEG's are valid. Files are validated using pillow so blame them not me.
